## Configuration Applied

### Environment Variables Set

#### Core Service:
- `DATABASE_URL`: postgres://postgres:hucLP5KIayqb0CEDOKjSX9UhmWW1wCXO@shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net:14513/railway
- `NODE_ENV`: production
- `PORT`: 3002
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001,https://*.railway.app

#### API Gateway:
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: your-groq-api-key-here (placeholder)
- `NODE_ENV`: production
- `PORT`: 3001
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: http://localhost:3000,https://*.railway.app
- `CORE_SERVICE_URL`: https://handycan-core-service-production.up.railway.app

### Code Modifications Made:
1. **Trust Proxy Configuration**: Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1);` to both services for Railway's reverse proxy
2. **Database TCP Proxy**: Created external TCP proxy for PostgreSQL access
3. **Service Configuration**: Set correct root directories and start commands

## Issues Identified and Resolutions

### 1. Trust Proxy Issue ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Express rate limiter was failing due to X-Forwarded-For headers without trust proxy setting.  
**Resolution**: Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1);` to both Express services.  
**Evidence**: API Gateway now working properly.

### 2. Database Hostname Resolution ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Internal hostname `pgvectorpgvectorlatest.railway.internal` was not resolving.  
**Resolution**: Created TCP proxy and updated DATABASE_URL to use external endpoint.  
**Current URL**: `shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net:14513`

### 3. Migration Process Issues ⚠️ ONGOING
**Issue**: Database migrations failing with connection reset errors during deployment.  
**Symptoms**: 
- `ECONNRESET` errors during migration
- "Connection terminated unexpectedly"
- Core service crashes before starting

**Attempted Solutions**:
- Removed migration from start command
- Used external TCP proxy for database connection
- Updated connection parameters

### 4. Service Deployment Strategy ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Initial deployment failures due to Railway.json configuration conflicts.  
**Resolution**: Updated service configuration through Railway API instead of relying on railway.json files.

## Current Service URLs

### API Gateway (Working)
- **Health Endpoint**: https://handycan-api-gateway-production.up.railway.app/health
- **Chat API**: https://handycan-api-gateway-production.up.railway.app/api/chat

### Core Service (Not Working)
- **Intended Health Endpoint**: https://handycan-core-service-production.up.railway.app/health
- **Intended API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/products`
  - `/api/guides`
  - `/api/compatibility`
  - `/api/stores`

### Database
- **External Connection**: `postgres://postgres:hucLP5KIayqb0CEDOKjSX9UhmWW1wCXO@shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net:14513/railway`
- **TCP Proxy ID**: 28a8ab3a-7315-43d0-a599-b7a70aea8e42

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Debug Core Service Database Connection**:
   - Investigate why database connection is being reset during migrations
   - Consider running migrations separately from service startup
   - Test database connectivity from Railway environment

2. **Update GROQ_API_KEY**:
   - Replace placeholder with actual Groq API key for LLM functionality
   - Test chat API functionality once core service is working

3. **Service Integration Testing**:
   - Test API Gateway -> Core Service communication
   - Verify CORS settings work with frontend
   - Test all API endpoints once core service is running

### Configuration to Provide to Android App:
```
API_GATEWAY_URL=https://handycan-api-gateway-production.up.railway.app
CORE_SERVICE_URL=https://handycan-core-service-production.up.railway.app (once working)
```

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

1. **Microservices Separation**: Clean separation between API Gateway and Core Service
2. **Database Isolation**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension properly isolated
3. **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently
4. **Security**: Proper CORS and rate limiting configured
5. **External Connectivity**: TCP proxy allows for external database connections if needed

## Cost Analysis

**Current Monthly Cost Estimate**: ~$38-45/month
- PostgreSQL with pgvector: ~$15/month
- API Gateway Service: ~$8/month  
- Core Service: ~$15/month
- TCP Proxy and additional features: ~$5/month

## Monitoring and Logs

- **Service Status**: Monitor through Railway dashboard
- **Health Endpoints**: API Gateway health check is working
- **Deployment History**: All deployment attempts logged in Railway
- **Error Tracking**: Connection errors visible in deployment logs

## GitHub Repository

**Repository**: https://github.com/moeloubani/handycan-backend  
**Last Commit**: c705084 - "Fix trust proxy settings for Railway deployment"

## Investigation Findings Summary

The deployment was largely successful with the API Gateway service functioning correctly and the database service deployed with proper pgvector extension. The main remaining issue is the Core Service's inability to complete its database migration process during startup, likely due to connection timeout or reset issues with the PostgreSQL service during the intensive migration process.

The trust proxy configuration fix resolved the primary deployment blocker, and the external TCP proxy approach successfully resolved the internal hostname resolution issues. The architecture is sound and ready for production use once the database migration issue is resolved.
