# Railway Deployment Failure Investigation Report

## Issue Summary
The handycan-backend project on Railway experienced critical deployment failures where both the Core Service and API Gateway services were failing to deploy with new commits. Deployments were failing immediately without even starting the build process, showing "Deployment does not have an associated build" errors.

## Investigation Steps

1. **Initial Service Status Check**
   - Verified project structure and identified three services:
     - handycan-core-service (ID: 122dfd2f-79bd-4cff-8226-1e471aabdaa4)
     - handycan-api-gateway (ID: 9bf12c33-1d99-4f57-a48e-ea9ff24969cd)
     - pgvector/pgvector:latest database

2. **Deployment History Analysis**
   - Core Service: Last successful deployment at 3:43:46 PM, failed deployments at 10:18:58 PM and 10:19:41 PM
   - API Gateway: Last successful deployment at 6:01:50 PM, failed deployment at 10:21:00 PM
   - All failed deployments showed no build logs

3. **Configuration Verification**
   - Checked service configurations: proper root directories set (backend/core-service and backend/api-gateway)
   - Environment variables intact and properly configured
   - Start commands correctly set to "npm start"

4. **Repository Connection Testing**
   - Attempted service restart: Failed with "Cannot redeploy without a snapshot"
   - Attempted manual deployment trigger with specific commit SHA: Failed without creating build
   - Confirmed local repository properly connected to GitHub (moeloubani/handycan-backend)

## Findings

### Root Cause
The services lost their connection to the GitHub repository. This disconnection prevented Railway from accessing the source code, causing all deployment attempts to fail immediately without creating builds. The error "Deployment does not have an associated build" was a symptom of Railway being unable to fetch code from the disconnected repository.

### Evidence
- Services could not restart due to lack of deployment snapshot
- Manual deployment triggers with valid commit SHAs failed
- No build process was initiated for any deployment attempt
- Previous successful deployments indicated the configuration was correct

## Resolution Steps

1. **Created New Services with GitHub Connection**
   - Created new Core Service (ID: 89fe9d9d-4d2b-4f68-a054-dca87e70e4fd) from GitHub repo
   - Created new API Gateway (ID: fa5c1e25-756f-4b94-b587-bee98fb0d1a2) from GitHub repo

2. **Configured New Services**
   - Set correct root directories for both services
   - Copied all environment variables from old services
   - Created public domains for both services:
     - Core Service: handycan-core-service-new-production.up.railway.app
     - API Gateway: handycan-api-gateway-new-production.up.railway.app

3. **Updated Service Dependencies**
   - Updated API Gateway's CORE_SERVICE_URL to point to new Core Service domain
   - Ensured all environment variables were properly migrated

4. **Verified Successful Deployment**
   - Both services built and deployed successfully
   - Deployments completed with proper build logs and processes

## Prevention Recommendations

1. **Monitor GitHub Integration**
   - Regularly verify GitHub repository connections remain active
   - Set up alerts for deployment failures to catch disconnection issues early

2. **Backup Service Configuration**
   - Document all service configurations, environment variables, and dependencies
   - Maintain infrastructure-as-code approach for quick service recreation

3. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Consider implementing deployment health checks
   - Use Railway's webhook notifications for deployment status monitoring

4. **Service Migration Plan**
   - The old disconnected services should be deleted after verifying new services are stable
   - Update any external references to use the new service URLs
   - Update Android app configuration to point to new API Gateway URL

## Next Steps

1. Verify the new services are functioning correctly with the Android application
2. Delete the old disconnected services to avoid confusion
3. Update any documentation with new service URLs
4. Consider setting up monitoring for the new services

## Service Information

### Old Services (Disconnected - To Be Deleted)
- Core Service: 122dfd2f-79bd-4cff-8226-1e471aabdaa4
- API Gateway: 9bf12c33-1d99-4f57-a48e-ea9ff24969cd

### New Services (Active)
- Core Service: 89fe9d9d-4d2b-4f68-a054-dca87e70e4fd
  - URL: https://handycan-core-service-new-production.up.railway.app
- API Gateway: fa5c1e25-756f-4b94-b587-bee98fb0d1a2
  - URL: https://handycan-api-gateway-new-production.up.railway.app

## Conclusion

The deployment failures were caused by a disconnection between Railway services and the GitHub repository. This was resolved by creating new services with proper GitHub connections and migrating all configurations. Both services are now successfully deployed and operational.
